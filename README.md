### Why do we build FluentSnippets?
Long story short, we manage many websites for our products and these are mostly content sites, our content team sometimes needs to add custom functionality for content placement and dynamic content blocks and we need a code snippets plugin as we manage our WP files via Git. We tried to use almost all the existing code snippets plugins and could not choose a single one because of the design decision these plugin authors made. Please read the full post to understand why we had to build a better solution to use our own.

### Design of FluentSnippets

You see, the design is super simple and this is what it should be! FluentSnippets stores the code snippets in the flat file and uses code blocks in each snippet file to add metadata like a description, title, conditional logic, snippet type, and other things. We also parse these data once and cache these into index.php so we donâ€™t have to parse these code blocks in every request. Then on runtime, it just includes those files to your selected action hook. In the whole process, FluentSnippets runs 0 database queries. In fact, we donâ€™t have any Database query in the whole plugin runtime.

With this native design, FluentSnippets is native, secure by design, and the most performant code snippets in this category.

### The code editor
The code editor of FluentSnippets is simple. We have used codemirror javascript library to add the code editor. It does not have advanced features like auto-complete.
