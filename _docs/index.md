- **Auto Disable:** FluentSnippets handle snippet errors automatically. So once a snippet has an error, it will be disabled automatically. If you want to alter this behavior then you can disable this feature.

### Safe Mode Settings

FluentSnippets may automatically disable a snippet on fatal error based your General Settings. There are still situations when you might get locked out by running a snippet that doesnâ€™t throw a fatal error on runtime. 
These scenarios are very rare but in case you run into that or you may just want to temporarily disable all the snippets on your site you can use the safe mode.

There has two-way, you can disable all the custom snippets on your site.

**By Safe Mode URL: **
You can disable all the custom snippets on your site by visiting the Safe Mode URL. The Safe Mode URL is something like this: `https://your-site.com/index.php?fluent_snippets=1&snippet_secret=RANDOM__SECURE_STRING`
The URL will be different for each site and you can find the URL in the Safe Mode Settings section.

**By Safe Mode Constant:**
You can also disable all the custom snippets on your site by defining a constant in your wp-config.php file. The constant is `FLUENT_SNIPPETS_SAFE_MODE` and you have to set the value to `true` to enable the safe mode.

```php
define( 'FLUENT_SNIPPETS_SAFE_MODE', true );
```
